    
        Is it possible for a JPA entity class to contain two embedded (@Embedded) fields? An example would be:

@Entity
public class Person {
    @Embedded
    public Address home;

    @Embedded
    public Address work;
}

public class Address {
    public String street;
    ...
}


In this case a Person can contain two Address instances - home and work. I'm using JPA with Hibernate's implementation. When I generate the schema using Hibernate Tools, it only embeds one Address. What I'd like is two embedded Address instances, each with its column names distinguished or pre-pended with some prefix (such as home and work). I know of @AttributeOverrides, but this requires that each attribute be individually overridden. This can get cumbersome if the embedded object (Address) gets big as each column needs to be individually overridden.
