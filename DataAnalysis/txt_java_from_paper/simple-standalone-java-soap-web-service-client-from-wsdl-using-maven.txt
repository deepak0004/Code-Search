    
        I'm looking to generate a simple standalone Java client which will make calls to a SOAP web service, given a wsdl.  When I say simple and standalone I mean that once I'm done I want to be able to do something like

import my.generated.nonsense;

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Client client = new Client();
    client.getSomething();
}


I've had great time recently with Maven on some other projects and I want to keep that going, so would aim to use it here.  I don't want the tool to generate anything expect the classes that allow me to do the above.

Anyone done this recently and can recommend a ws library and Maven plugin?  Thanks.
