    
        Perhap this is a simple basic question

Having an enum

public enum TK{
        ID,GROUP,DATA,FAIL;
        }


Can I get the order number for example ID=0, GROUP=2, DATA=3, FAIL=4 ?

This is a way to to that, but a weird and long one! =S 

public enum TK{
        ID(0),GROUP(1),DATA(2),FAIL(3);

        int num;
        TK(int n)
        {
           this.num=n;
        }

        public int get()
        {
           return num;
        }

  };


to get numbers so I write TK.ID.get(), TK.GROUP.get(), etc... I don't like that

there is a better way?

( C enums, C macros..I miss you both )

thanks
