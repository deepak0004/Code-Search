    
        I have a JAX-RS web service implemented with Jersey library and now I want to test it. In order to do that I'd like to host this service in my test by preinitializing it with mocked services.

What is the best way to host such a service and execute the test calls?

@Path("/srv")
public class MyService
{
   @GET
   public void action(@Context UriInfo uri)
   { ... }
}

@Test
public void myTest()
{
   MyService service = new MyService();
   service.setSomething(...);

   // How do I host it?

   // How do I call it?
}
