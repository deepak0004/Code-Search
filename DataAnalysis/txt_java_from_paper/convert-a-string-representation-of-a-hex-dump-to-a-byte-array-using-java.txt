    
        I am looking for a way to convert a long string (from a dump), that represents hex values into a byte array.

I couldn't have phrased it better than the person that posted the same question here:

But to keep it original, I'll phrase it my own way: suppose I have a string "00A0BF" that I would like interpreted as the byte[] {0x00,0xA0,0xBf} what should I do?

I am a Java novice and ended up using BigInteger and watching out for leading hex zeros. But I think it is ugly and I am sure I am missing something simple...
