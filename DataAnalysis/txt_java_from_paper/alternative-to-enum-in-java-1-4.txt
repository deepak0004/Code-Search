    
        Since Java 1.4 doesn't have enums I'm am doing something like this:

public class SomeClass {
     public static int SOME_VALUE_1 = 0;
     public static int SOME_VALUE_2 = 1;
     public static int SOME_VALUE_3 = 2;

     public void receiveSomeValue(int someValue) {
            // do something
     }
 }


The caller of receiveSomeValue should pass one those 3 values but he can pass any other int. 
If it were an enum the caller could only pass one valid value.

Should receiveSomeValue throw an InvalidValueException?

What are good alternatives to Java 5 enums?
