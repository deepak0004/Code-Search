    
        I have the following :

Runnable done = new Runnable()
    {
        public void run()
        {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    };


And then in my Android activity I'll call something like : 

runOnUIThread(done);


Which I then call. However, I want that "Hello" not to be hardcoded, so I can pass it in. Otherwise I'll have to have one of these declarations for every String I want to print.

(This is actually an android question, but slimmed it down to basic Java so its easier to answer)

Thanks
