    
        I see that Google App Engine can host  web applications that will return html, etc. But what about web services that communicate over http and accept / return xml?

Does anyone know how this is being done in Goggle App Engine with Python or for that matter in Java (JAS-WX is not supported)? Any links o samples or articles is greatly appreciated.

Thanks // :)
