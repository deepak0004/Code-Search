    
        I realize it's a chicken and egg problem and that it's not possible to accurately resolve the time it took to render a page (or the size of response) and insert that number into the page itself without affecting either measure. Nevertheless, I'm looking for a way to insert either number partially in a page of a JSF/Facelets/Seam application.

E.g., at the bottom of a .jsf page somewhere:

&lt;!-- page size: 10.3Kb --&gt;
&lt;!-- render time: 0.2s --&gt;


I've come across JSFUnit's <a href="http://community.jboss.org/wiki/JSFUnitPerformanceAnalysis" rel="nofollow">JSFTimer, which is really handy. However, the phase listener approach doesn't allow the results of RENDER_RESPONSE phase to be inserted into the page. Not sure how to access the size of the response encoded so far either.

Is there a quick and dirty way to hook up to some sort of post-processing event at or after the end of RENDER_RESPONSE and to inject both numbers into the page about to be rendered? One way of approaching this is perhaps through servlet filters, but I'm looking for something simpler; perhaps a trick with Seam or Facelets...

Thanks,
-A
