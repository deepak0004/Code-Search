    
        There are lots of threads about this type of question, but I want to get a complete answer and actually understand it without 'hiding' the problem with a @SupressWarnings !

I have the following class (from a simple Spring tutorial)

public class CarValidator implements Validator {

public boolean supports(Class aClass) {
	return Car.class.equals(aClass);
}

public void validate(Object obj, Errors errors) {
	Car car = (Car) obj;

	ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "model", "field.required", "Required field");

	ValidationUtils.rejectIfEmptyOrWhitespace(errors, "price", "field.required", "Required field");

	if( ! errors.hasFieldErrors("price")) {
		if (car.getPrice().intValue() == 0)
			errors.rejectValue("price", "not_zero", "Can't be free!");
	}

}


}

Where the Validator class is the org.springframework.validation.Validator class from Spring 2.5.

The supports method is showing a warning (Class is a raw type. References to generic type Class should be parameterized), if I try to add parameters to this such as 

public boolean supports(Class&lt;?&gt; aClass) ...


I get the follwing error:

The method supports(Class) of type CarValidator has the same erasure as supports(Class) of type Validator but does not override it

I would be very grateful if someone could fully explain this please and put me out of my misery. 

My applogies in advance, I've been in a 1.4 world for too long!
