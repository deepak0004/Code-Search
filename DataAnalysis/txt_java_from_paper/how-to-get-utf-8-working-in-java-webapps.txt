    
        I need to get UTF-8 working in my Java webapp (servlets + JSP, no framework used) to support дце etc. for regular Finnish text and Cyrillic alphabets like ??? for special cases.

My setup is the following:


Development encironment: Windows XP
Production encironment: Debian


Database used: MySQL 5.x

Users mainly use Firefox2 but also Opera 9.x, FF3, IE7 and Google Chrome are used to access the site.

How to achieve this?
