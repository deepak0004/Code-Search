    
        I tried searching in Google, but I could not find any good examples where a username and password are checked with a database for authentication purposes.

In further simple words, how can I create a simple login form using Spring and Hibernate where the credentials are checked with the database.

Update

Cam anyone come up with a simple example where I can see how the flow goes and how the input data is passed to hibernate?
