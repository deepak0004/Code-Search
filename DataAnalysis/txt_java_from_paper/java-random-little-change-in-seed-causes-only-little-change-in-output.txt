    
        While making a map generator in Java I found a rather unnerving problem with their random number generator, to specify, when two RNGs have very similar seeds (differing in small integers) their first output value will become very similar!

Example code:

Random r = new Random();
long n = 100000; //Choose any number
r.setSeed(n);  
System.out.println(r.nextInt());
r.setSeed(n+1);
System.out.println(r.nextInt());


This pretty much broke my faith in the original Java RNG, since I use coordinates to seed a map generator.
Could someone suggest either a redefinition for the Random.next(int bits) method, or some other fix for this problem?

Thank you for your help!
