    
        I'm at the beginning/middle of a project that we chose to implement using GWT. Has anyone encountered any major pitfalls in using GWT (and GWT-EXT) that were unable to be overcome? How about from a performance perspective?

A couple things that we've seen/heard already include:


Google not being able to index content
CSS and styling in general seems to be a bit flaky


Looking for any additional feedback on these items as well. Thanks!
