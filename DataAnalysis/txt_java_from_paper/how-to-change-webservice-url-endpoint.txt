    
        I generated a web-service client using JBoss utils (JAX-WS compatible)
using Eclipse 'web service client from a wsdl'.

So, the only thing I provided was a url to a web-service WSDL.

Now, the web service provider tells me to change the "url of client endpoint application access" of the web-service.

What is it and how to change it?
