    
        I have a string something like |serialNo|checkDelta?|checkFuture?|checkThis?|.

Now i am using the following code to split the string.

String[] splitString = str.split("|");

but when i use this i get array of string that contains each and every alphabet, whereas i need string which contains letter like serialNo, checkDelta?, checkFuture?, checkthis?.

How to get these? Am i missing some thing?

Thanks
