    
        I have a StringBuilder object that needs to be trimmed (i.e. all whitespace chars /u0020 and below removed from either end).

I can't seem to find a method in string builder that would do this.

Here's what I'm doing now:

String trimmedStr = strBuilder.toString().trim();


This gives exactly the desired output, but it requires two Strings to be allocated instead of one.  Is there a more efficient to trim the string while it's still in the StringBuilder?
