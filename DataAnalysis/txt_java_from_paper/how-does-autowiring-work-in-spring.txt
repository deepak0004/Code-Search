    
        I'm a little confused as to how the IOC works in spring.

Say I have a service class called UserServiceImpl that implements UserService interface.

How would this be auto-wired?

And in my Controllers action, how would I instantiate an instance of this service?

Would I just do:

UserService userService = new UserServiceImpl();
