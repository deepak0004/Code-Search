    
        Is it possible to use a DB sequence for some column that is not the identifier/is not part of a composite identifier? 

I'm using hibernate as jpa provider, and I have a table that has some columns that are generated values (using a sequence), although they are not part of the identifier.

What I want is to use a sequence to create a new value for an entity, where the column for the sequence is NOT (part of) the primary key:

@Entity
@Table(name = "MyTable")
public class MyEntity {

    //...
    @Id //... etc
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

   //note NO @Id here! but this doesn't work...
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO, generator = "myGen")
    @SequenceGenerator(name = "myGen", sequenceName = "MY_SEQUENCE")
    @Column(name = "SEQ_VAL", unique = false, nullable = false, insertable = true, updatable = true)
    public Long getMySequencedValue(){
      return myVal;
    }

}


Then when I do this:

em.persist(new MyEntity());


the id will be generated, but the mySequenceVal property will be also generated by my JPA provider.

Just to make things clear: I want Hibernate to generate the value for the mySequencedValue property. I know Hibernate can handle database-generated values, but I don't want to use a trigger or any other thing other than Hibernate itself to generate the value for my property. If Hibernate can generate values for primary keys, why can't it generate for a simple property?
