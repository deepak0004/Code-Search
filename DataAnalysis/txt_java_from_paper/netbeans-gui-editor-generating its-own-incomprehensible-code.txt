    
        When creating a new project in netbeans, if i select JAVA Desktop application, it creates some code which I DO NOT RECOGNISE AT ALL as what i had learnt in swing.

It imports packages such as :

org.jdesktop.application.SingleFrameApplication;


also, the declaration for main() looks like this :

public static void main(String[] args) {
            launch(DesktopApplication2.class, args);
        }


This really does not make any sense to my knowledge of JFrame, JPanel etc..

If i try to code a  netbeans application from scratch, i can write my own swing app BUT I CANNOT FIND THE GUI EDITOR.


How do i bring the GUI editor when creating java application from scratch ?
Can anyone explain to me this org.jdesktop.application.SingleFrameApplication and other classes ? 


Please help. This is really frustrating.
