    
        I am having a lot of trouble finding good information on how to call a standard SOAP/WSDL web service with Android. All I've been able to find are either very convoluted documents and references to "kSoap2" and then some bit about parsing it all manually with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML" rel="nofollow">SAX. OK, that's fine, but it's 2008 so I figured there should be some good library for calling standard web services.

The web service is just basically one created in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans" rel="nofollow">NetBeans. I would like to have IDE support for generating the plumbing classes. I just need the easiest/most-elegant way to contact a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language" rel="nofollow">WSDL based web service from an Android based phone.
