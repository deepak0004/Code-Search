    
        Why am i not allowed to do this?

public abstract class A {}
public class B extends A {}
...

public ArrayList&lt;A&gt; foo()
{
  return new ArrayList&lt;B&gt;();
}


I changed to public since there are so many people that love to point stupid errors.

Why should i have to write ALL this code. Just to satisfy Java's non-senses?

public List&lt;A&gt; foo() 
{ 
  List&lt;A&gt; aList = new ArrayList&lt;A&gt;(); 
  List&lt;B&gt; bList = new ArrayList&lt;B&gt;();
  /* fill bList*/

  for (B b : bList)
  {
    aList.add(b);
  }
  return aList;
}
