    
        I'm currently taking a course in Java and I've run into some confusing code.

Example:

Runnable runnable = new Runnable()
        {
            public void run()
            {
                //doStuff
            }
        };


I don't really get what this code is doing.

How can the run method be associated with an instance of a class?

I googled "Runnable" and found out that it is an interface. Am I implementing the interface by declaring the run method between curly brackets ? Can this be done for any interface in java ?

I could use some links/explanations. Thank you!
