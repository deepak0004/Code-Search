    
        How would I be able to accomplish the following:

public class testClass implements Interface {
     public testClass(Interface[] args) {
     }
}


So that I could declare 

Interface testObject = new testClass(new class1(4), new class2(5));


Where class1 and class2 are also classes that implement Interface.

Also, once I accomplish this, how would I be able to refer to each individual parameter taken in to be used in testClass?

Thanks :)
