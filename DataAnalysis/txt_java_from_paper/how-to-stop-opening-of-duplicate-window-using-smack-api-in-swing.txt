    
        I have 2 swing classes which extends JFrame. Both have show() method in there constructor. From ClassOne i called ClassTwo like new ClassTwo() on button click event. But if i press the button again new window for ClassTwo is opened. So how can i stop opening of ClassTwo window if one ClassTwo window is opened ?

Edit

now this problem is solved but now when i first open ClassTwo window it shows one window. Then after closing it when i again open ClassTwo window it opens two window and this count keep on increamenting. Why this is happening?

EDIT 2

I found that its not swing problem but its problem from MultiUsreChat class of Samck API. So anyone who have worked on it help me.

the code in ClassOne is:

if(!winList.contains(room_jid)){
    new ClassTwo(room_jid,....);
    winList.add(room_jid);
}


and in ClassTwo is:

public ClassTwo(....){
......
    this.muc = new MultiUserChat(connection, room_jid);
    if(!muc.isJoined())
        muc.join(this.user_id);      //---- This line opens previously closed window.
.....

    if(!isVisible())
       show();

}


Edit 3

constructor of classone

public ClassOne(){
  JButton btn = new JButton("Open");
  btn.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){
     public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){
       if(!winList.contains(room_jid)){
           new ClassTwo(room_jid,....);
            winList.add(room_jid);
       }
     }
  });
}
