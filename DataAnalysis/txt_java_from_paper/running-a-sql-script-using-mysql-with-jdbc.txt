    
        I am starting to use MySQL with JDBC.

Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
conn = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql:///x", "x", "x");
stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.execute( "CREATE TABLE amigos" +
            "("+
            "id          int AUTO_INCREMENT          not null,"+
            "nombre      char(20)                    not null,"+
            "primary key(id)" +
            ")");


I have 3-4 tables to create and this doesn't look good.

Is there a way to run a .sql script from MySQL JDBC?
