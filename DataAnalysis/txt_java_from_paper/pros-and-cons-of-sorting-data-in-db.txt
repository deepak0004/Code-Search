What is the best way (for performance): add order by field to the SQL-query or sort the data when it's already fetched?

I'm using Java (with Hibernate), but I can't tell anything about DB engine. It could be any popular relational database (like MySQL or MS Sql Server or Oracle or HSQL DB or any other).

The amount of records in table can vary greatly but let's assume there are 5k records.

UPD: how well does 2nd level hibernate cache (EHCache for example) support sorted data?
