    
        I'm currently working on a simple game in Java with several different modes. I've extended a main Game class to put the main logic within the other classes. Despite this, the main game class is still pretty hefty.

After taking a quick look at my code the majority of it was Getters and Setters (60%) compared to the rest that is truly needed for the logic of the game.

A couple of Google searches have claimed that Getters and Setters are evil, whilst others have claimed that they are necessary for good OO practice and great programs.

What are your opinions on this? Should I be changing my Getters and Setters for my private variables or should I stick with them?
