Given this fact I choose to use a double type as a single type for all my types, since my largest integer is unsigned 32-bit.

But now I have to print these pseudo integers, but the problem is they are also mixed in with actual doubles.

So how do I print these doubles nicely in Java?

I have tried String.format("%f", value), which is close, except I get a lot of trailing zeros for small values.

Here's an example output of of %f


232.00000000
0.18000000000
1237875192.0
4.5800000000
0.00000000


Sure I can write a function to trim those zeros, but that's lot of performance loss due to String manipulation.  Can I do better with another format code?
