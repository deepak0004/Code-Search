    
        Can somebody suggest an easy way to get a reference to a file as a String/InputStream/File/etc type object in a junit test class?  Obviously I could paste the file (xml in this case) in as a giant String or read it in as a file but is there a shortcut specific to Junit like this?

public class MyTestClass{

@Resource(path="something.xml")
File myTestFile;

@Test
public void toSomeTest(){
...
}

}
