    
        How could I "intercept" Ctrl+C (which normally would kill the process)
in a CLI (command line interface) Java application?

Does a multi-platform solution exist (Linux, Solaris, Windows)?

I'm using Console's readLine(), but if necessary, I could use some other method
to read characters from standard input.
